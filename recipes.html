            <p>This meal is a cheap and easy alternative to the classic cheap college meal: ramen noodles. It cooks up in about 10
            minutes, and offers a ton of flavor and a more filling alternative to the typical packaged food. There is also plenty of
            room for culinary freedom and expression by adding extra sauces or spices, and substituting the pork for something like
            chicken for a healthier protein option.</p>

            <h3>Recipe Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup chili garlic sauce</li>

            <p>This recipe is a fantastic way to step up your pasta game without taking too much more of your time. It tastes way better than basic pasta with jarred sauce! I originally found this when my sister made it, and got the recipe off of Bon Appetit’s website. PS avoid using the shaker parmesan – I used that the first time I made this and it drew down the quality of the dish.</p>
